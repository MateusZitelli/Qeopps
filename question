Ask HN: Parallel programs that could be optimized with genetic algorithms

I'm developing a tool in my scientific initiation witch uses genetic algorithms for optimization of parallel programs in C with Posix threads, positioning mutex locks.

I'm searching for problems that are not very hard to implement but could get a real improvement with a tool like that.
